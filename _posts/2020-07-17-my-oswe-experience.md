I've had my eyes in the AWAE course for several months, and initially thought it would be too difficult for me to do this year. But then I just decided to give it a try!

**Note**: This blog post is very low quality compared to the one I wrote about [My OSCP experience](/my-oscp-experience), I encourage you to go read [An experience leading up to Offensive Security Web Expert](https://loca1gh0s7.github.io/another-awae-oswe-exam-experience-and-preparation/) by loca1gh0s7, which was my inspiration for starting on this journey.

## My advice

### Pre-AWAE advice

This is not a beginner certification. Unless you already work as a developer, you should really look into some basic coding before attempting this course.

### AWAE advice

-   As with the other OFfensive Security courses, read all of the PDF!
-   Take notes ([I recommend Markdown in VS Code](/using-vs-code-for-note-taking))
-   Do the exercises and write down your steps (good training for the exam report, and nice to have later)
-   Do the extra miles
-   Use the latest Kali, or whatever Linux distro you prefer
-   Do not treat this as a "Code Review Certification", this is a penetration testing certification, with a white box focus

### Exam advice

-   Schedule your exam as soon as possible
-   Schedule the exam for a time slot that best fits you
-   Use the provided report template
-   Keep it simple
-   Take notes and screenshots (make sure you get the required screenshots!)
-   Do not treat this as a "Code Review Exam"! This is a penetration testing certification, use the code to your advantage, but also use your regular penetration testing techniques

## My background

I've been a hobby coder since I was 10, and a professional developer for a long time. That background did without a doubt help me a lot on this certification.

## Pre-AWAE

I finished the entire [eLearnSecurity Web Application Penetration Tester Training Path](/elearnsecurity-web-application-pentester) before starting on AWAE. The certifications are very different in some ways, but that clearly helped me prepare for this.

## AWAE

This was my 7th certification in less than 8 months, and I started the AWAE course during the summer. This made me a lot less focused than I was during the other courses/certifications, and I ended up not finishing all the exercises. I instead focused on the ones I thought would be most beneficial to me.

The AWAE update was released the same day as I submitted my exam report, but Offensive Security was nice enough to give all existing students a free upgrade.

If I had taken this course earlier, I would have spent a lot more time on the extra miles. And I might revisit them later, at least the ones I can work on without access to the labs.

## OSWE Exam

The OSWE exam is hard, as it should be. But 48 hours is plenty of time, as long as you remember to take breaks, sleep and eat.

I managed to get all the exam objectives. Even though I got stuck a couple times, this exam was mostly fun and exciting.

By far my favorite exam!

## The (not so) long wait

I was used to waiting for exam results by now, but this one wasn't nearly as long as the previous ones. Only a couple days later, I got the confirmation that I had passed!

## Time spent

I decided that I wanted to track all the time I spent doing the course and the exam, so I have very accurate numbers of how much time I used.

Total hours spent: **63**

| Task                     | Hours spent          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Notes, preparation, etc. | 3 hours, 11 minutes  |
| Study (PDF)              | 12 hours, 36 minutes |
| Study (Videos)           | 8 hours, 23 minutes  |
| Exercises/Labs           | 5 hours, 41 minutes  |
| Extra miles              | 4 hours, 19 minutes  |
| Exam                     | 24 hours, 14 minutes |
| Exam Report              | 4 hours, 45 minutes  |
